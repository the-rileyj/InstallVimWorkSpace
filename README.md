# Vim Installer

## About

There comes a time where I am on a machine that doesn't have my prefered Vim settings, this speeds up the process for getting things going.

## Usage

```bash
$ curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/the-rileyj/InstallVimWorkSpace/master/VimInstaller.sh -s | bash
Successfully Finished
```
